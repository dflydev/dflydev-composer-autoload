Composer Autoload Tools
=======================

Provide a standard interface for accessing Composer's autoloader.


Why?
----

While it is generally not considered best practice for an application
to be aware of underlying autoloaders, or be aware of how Composer
is managing things, accessing the autoloader is sometimes a
necessity. This library helps get access to the underlying Composer
autoloader registered during runtime.


Requirements
------------

 * PHP 5.3+
